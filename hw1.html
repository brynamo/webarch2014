<p>Most of my experience with web architecture has been as a website/database administrator. I’ve written HTML, CSS and some Javascript, though I have tried to leverage CSS3 wherever possible. I’m assuming you are asking this first to get an understanding where we are at but also understand where we want to go (within reason). My main interest is in privacy and security but I have a design background originally.</p>
<p>I would say that I really enjoy chrome’s integration with brackets (an editor) to quickly model pages. I also really like Firefox’s responsive design mode, it makes working with media queries much easier.</p>
